Comments addressed/changes made:

-Instead of deciding which half of the data to process in the sorters, the parent now passes in the correct range through the constructor
-The process destructor now waits correctly
-Virtual destructor added to sort_strategy.hxx
-business() in inherited classes changed to be virtual
-mq_sorter works correctly due to sending a blank initial message
-Edge case checking added (if data has one member)
-Exit status of child process depends on successful completion
-shm fully implemented, error checking added to semaphore and shm
-(as addressed in office hours) parent now waits on child and throws upon bad exit status
